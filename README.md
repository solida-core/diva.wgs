# DiVA WGS
**DiVA WGS** is a pipeline for Next-Generation Sequencing **Whole Genome** data anlysis.

All **[solida-core](https://github.com/solida-core)** workflows follow GATK Best Practices for Germline Variant Discovery, with the incorporation of further improvements and refinements after their testing with real data in various [CRS4 Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility](http://next.crs4.it) research sequencing projects.

Pipelines are based on [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a workflow management system that provides all the features needed to create reproducible and scalable data analyses.

Software dependencies are specified into the `environment.yaml` file and directly managed by Snakemake using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), ensuring the reproducibility of the workflow on a great number of different computing environments such as workstations, clusters and cloud environments.


### Pipeline Overview
The pipeline workflow is composed by two major analysis sections:
 * [_Mapping_](docs/diva_workflow.md#mapping): single and/or paired-end reads in fastq format are aligned against a reference genome to produce a deduplicated and recalibrated BAM file. This section is executed by DiMA pipeline.

 * [_Variant Calling_](docs/diva_workflow.md#variant-calling): a joint call is performed from all project's bam files
 
Parallely, statistics collected during these steps are used to generate reports for [Quality Control](docs/diva_workflow.md#quality-control).

A complete view of the analysis workflow is provided by the pipeline's [graph](images/diva-wgs.png).
